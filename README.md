This project was designed to help create a simple webapp that would help me practice learning TypeScript. While I have previously created a To Do List utilizing React and Javascript I wanted to test out creating a different version using Typescript. 

The main function of this project allows users to create, read, update and delete to do list items

I used the colors from my favorite baseball team to help quickly style the website. 

You can find the code for this project here https://github.com/SeaAustinCode/To-Do-List---Typescript
